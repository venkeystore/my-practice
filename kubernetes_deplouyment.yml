#kubernetes deployment yaml syntax

#Sure! Here is a brief syntax guide for creating Kubernetes deployment YAML files:


apiVersion: apps/v1              # the API version of the Kubernetes object 
kind: Deployment                # the type of Kubernetes object

metadata:
  name: my-deployment           # the name of the deployment
  labels:                       # labels to associate with the deployment
    app: my-app

spec:
  selector:                     # the pod selector used to match the replicas
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  replicas: 3                   # the number of replicas to create
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app            # the labels of the pod created
    spec:
      containers:               # the list of containers defined in the pod
        - name: my-container    # the name of the container
          image: my-image       # the container image to use
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80 # the port to expose on the container


#This is just a basic example to get you started. You can add more fields and customize the deployment to your specific needs. Hope it helps!

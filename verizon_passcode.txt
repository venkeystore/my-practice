10. How do I VPN to DevNet?
If you are authorized to use DevNet (see "How do I get on DevNet?" above), you will be able to VPN in from home, from the corporate network, etc. Your existing Duo ID will work â€“ no need to change anything with that. 

You will, however, need to manually add a new connection in Pulse. (warning)There are separate URLs for Windows PC and Apple OS X (MAC) Junos Pulse client applications.(warning)

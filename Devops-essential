DaemonSet:
==========
A DaemonSet in Kubernetes ensures that a specific Pod runs on every node (or selected nodes) in a cluster. 
It is used for logging, monitoring, networking, security, storage, and system maintenance tasks. 
Examples include Prometheus Node Exporter, Fluentd, Falco, and Calico. 
DaemonSets automatically deploy and manage these essential services across all required nodes. ðŸš€

In mysystem i used for system maintenance/manageing by deploying the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on GPU-enabled nodes. 
It ensures that required GPU runtime components are available across all nodes that support NVIDIA GPU workloads in Kubernetes.


The NVIDIA Container Toolkit enables GPU support in containers by providing necessary runtime components for Kubernetes and Docker. 
GPU-enabled nodes are Kubernetes worker nodes equipped with NVIDIA GPUs, allowing accelerated computing for AI, ML, and HPC workloads by offloading processing tasks from CPUs to GPUs for improved performance. ðŸš€

Without a **DaemonSet**, essential node-level services like **logging, monitoring, networking, security, and GPU management** won't run automatically on each node, 
requiring manual Pod deployment, leading to inconsistent configurations and increased operational complexity. ðŸš€
